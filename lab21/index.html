			<h2>Task</h2>
			<p>For this lab we are furthering our sketches for what our team
				 project pages would look like.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>For this lab I had a problem thinking of how to further sketches I was
			not to interested in furthering. My team did give me feedback of making
		my page look more like the HBO page. I had my original sketches of the home page
	instead of the page I was working on.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p> I was able to get my 2nd draft of sketches done and added as much detail
				 as I could. The content on the page I am not very aware of. Also,
				 happened to take the same time to think about different designs.</p>
