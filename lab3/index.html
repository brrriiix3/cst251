<h1>File Structures</h1>
<p>This lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and
	add index.html files.</p>

<h2>My Problems</h2>
<p>I can't seem to link my pages back to the main index.It is stressing me out.
	I do not like how I can't figure it out. Making new html's was easy for me after
deleting them and making them over and over again.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I got the hang of making the new files. On atom it was a bit hard
	but, on my computer I was able to make them faster.</p>
