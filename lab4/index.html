		<h1>File Transfer</h1>

		<h2>Committing local files to the GitHub server.</h2>


		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>I only had one issue when committing to GitHub. I would make a change that would
			not show up. I realized I was not saving the code I was writing, therefore it
			would not appear on my browser. I added some css code to change the background color
		for some reason it won't apply to one of my pages. I linked it and tried changing it
		directly in that page and it still won't change. When looking through my code, I found
		I was refrencing the wrong css page.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
