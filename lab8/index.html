        <h1>Lab 8</h1>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <p>Working with a partner to experiment with the CSS selectors. Using the
        hover method to enlarge an image in our CSS stylesheet.</p>
        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p>Deciding on what types of CSS to use. When trying to enlarge the
        image using the hover method, my image would stay the same size but
        move either left, right, up, or down. I should start to read my code
        out-loud to make sure I do not miss certain words or punctuation.
        Double checking with the format so I use everything correctly.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p id="result">Everything came out fine and I am happy with this page.
        I want to work more on the other lab pages to make it look more cohesive.
        For now this works because it shows the progression of where I was when
        we started to all the new things I learned.</p>
