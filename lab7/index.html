    <h1>Lab 7</h1>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>Adding details with the CSS files.</p>
    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I could not get my images to style with the
			CSS page. It was hard to figure out but with help
			from my lab partner we figured it out. We are not
			sure if the way we solved our problem was how Wes
	   wanted us to solve it, so we asked our slack channel
		  for input.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>This lab has been a bit trickier than the rest. I did
			google more to find out how different style tags did and
			how to use. My partner and I did run into a couple of issues
			and decided to get help from our class slack channel and from w3schools.
		Most things for me worked just the way I wanted but, I still
	would want to continue to style it and have my ideas in my head work
on the site.</p>
