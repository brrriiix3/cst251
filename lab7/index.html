    <h1>Lab 7</h1>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>Adding details with the CSS files.</p>
    <h3>Problems</h3>
    <p>I could not get my images to style with the
			CSS page. It was hard to figure out but with help
			from my lab partner we figured it out. We are not
			sure if the way we solved our problem was how Wes
	   wanted us to solve it, so we asked our slack channel
		  for input.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>We got help from our class slack channel and from w3schools.</p>
