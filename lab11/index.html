      <p>I decided to write a bit about my 3 1/2 month old kitten. Her name in
        Cersi and I have been taking care of her since she was roughly 2 weeks
        old. She is very curious and loves to explore. Her fellow roommates are
        a 8 year old cat and a 5 week old puppy. As seen in the pictures she is adventurous
        and ready for the spooky season.</p>

        <p>I was having issues with making the sidebar and what exactly the navigation
          bar was supposed to look like. I did ask my partner, Connor for some help
          with this lab and he was able to give me instruction on how to figure it out.</p>
